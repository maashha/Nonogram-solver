* As input Nonogram_solver requires a file containing a layout of a Japanese crossword puzzle. The first line of the file determines the number of rows and columns in the puzzle. Each subsequent row then lists the shaded cells for each row or column separately. Then as output you get solved nonogram as a picture.
* parsing.py parses such crosswords from the site into the required form to use them as examples of possible nonograms.
